# 1.Satellite Telemetry Simulator
## Project Purpose:
Simulation of satellite telemetry data collection, including:
- Generating measurement data (voltage, temperature),
- Packing data in JSON format,
- Detecting and marking errors (values out of range).

## Features
- Simulation of satellite sensors (voltage, temperature).
- Identification and marking of invalid measurements.
- Assigning unique packet IDs and timestamps.
- Preparing data for later transmission (e.g., TCP).
